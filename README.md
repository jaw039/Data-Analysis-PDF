# Data-Analysis-PDF

This repository contains coursework for DSC190, showcasing five distinct data analysis projects using R. Each project demonstrates a range of data analysis techniques, statistical methods, and visualization skills.

## Projects Overview

1. **Analysing the Programming Language Preferences of Data Scientists in 2020**
   - Explores survey data from Kaggle to analyze programming language usage and educational backgrounds.
   - Techniques: binary encoding, chi-square tests, clustering, random forest classification.

2. **Detecting Replication Patterns in HCMV through Palindrome Analysis**
   - Investigates palindrome patterns in genomic data using simulation and statistical tests.
   - Techniques: Monte Carlo simulation, Q-Q plots, KS tests, cluster analysis.

3. **Maternal Smoking and Birth Weight**
   - Examines the impact of maternal smoking on birth weight using statistical comparisons.
   - Techniques: data cleaning, permutation tests, kurtosis analysis, group comparisons.

4. **Statistical Analysis and Calibration of a Gamma Transmission Gauge**
   - Analyzes calibration data for a gamma transmission gauge with regression and prediction methods.
   - Techniques: linear/log-linear regression, prediction intervals, reverse prediction, robustness testing.

5. **Video Gaming Patterns and Academic Performance**
   - Studies the relationship between video gaming habits and academic performance.
   - Techniques: bootstrapping, confidence intervals, demographic analysis, hypothesis testing.

## Skills Demonstrated

- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, recoding, filtering, and outlier removal.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualizations like histograms, barplots, and heatmaps.
- **Statistical Testing**: Chi-square tests, KS tests, permutation tests, and bootstrap methods.
- **Modeling & Prediction**: Regression analysis, clustering, and random forest classification.
- **Simulation**: Monte Carlo methods and resampling techniques.
- **Reproducible Reporting**: Scripts and tables generated with R and knitr.

## Tools & Libraries

- **R**: Base R and packages like `dplyr`, `caret`, `randomForest`, `corrplot`, and `knitr`.
- **Data Sources**: Includes survey data, genomic data, and other text/delimited files.

Feel free to explore the individual project folders for detailed scripts and reports. Each project folder contains the R script and a corresponding PDF report summarizing the analysis.
